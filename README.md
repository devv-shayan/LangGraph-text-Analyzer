# Text Processing Workflow with Google Gemini AI

This project sets up a text classification, entity extraction, and summarization pipeline using Google Gemini AI and `langgraph`. We use a state-based graph to structure the workflow, which allows for step-by-step processing of the text.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
!pip install langgraph
!pip install langchain
!pip install langchain-google-genai
!pip install python-dotenv
