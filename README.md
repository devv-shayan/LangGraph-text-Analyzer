# Text Processing Workflow with Google Gemini AI


This project introduces LangGraph, a powerful framework for creating modular, graph-based AI workflows. You will learn how to leverage LangGraph to build more complex and flexible AI agents that can handle multi-step processes efficiently.
This project sets up a text classification, entity extraction, and summarization pipeline using Google Gemini AI and `langgraph`. We use a state-based graph to structure the workflow, which allows for step-by-step processing of the text.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
!pip install langgraph
!pip install langchain
!pip install langchain-google-genai
!pip install python-dotenv
